# BatRAT 3.0
üñ•Ô∏è Fast, light-weight remote administration tool made purely in Batch, fully undetected by most anti-malware programs.
Some modules were made in NirCMD and PowerShell.

Note: The source code will be never released due to the potential of abuse. I do not want my program to be abused by threat actors to cause problems. I am making this GitHub as a documentation for my project.

## üîë How does it work?
There are 2 versions of BatRAT;
- Server
  - Sends commands on PHP website
  - Contains full list of commands
  - Server version has full control of client version
- Client
  - Accepts commands from PHP website that server sends
  - Does all the commands requested and returns on PHP website or a Discord webhook

1) PHP server needs to be setup as C&C
2) Server sends command on PHP server in format `Server;commandname`
3) Client receives command from PHP server, does the command, returns answer on PHP server in format `%username%@%computername%;answer`

## üîí Detection status
  - ‚úÖ **Avast**: Fully bypassed. RAT was able to work without a single issue.
  - ‚úÖ **Avira**: Fully bypassed.
  - ‚úÖ **Windows Defender**: Fully bypassed.
  - ‚úÖ **AVG**: Fully bypassed.
  - ‚úÖ **KVRT (Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool)**: Full bypassed. Unable to test with normal Kaspersky/UltraAV.
  - ‚úÖ **ESET Online Scanner**: Fully bypassed. I have no idea how that happened, since it does not bypass normal ESET.
  - ‚úÖ **HitmanPro Scanner**: Fully bypassed.
  - ‚úÖ **Malwarebytes scan & realtime protection**: Fully bypassed.
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **ESET Endpoint Antivirus**: Fully bypassed with all modules including Live Grid enabled. RAT was able to work without single issue. Note: After 3 days, ESET is now detecting as BAT/Agent.DO. This is probably caused by Live Grid automatic file submitting system.
  - ‚ùå **BitDefender**: Every version of BatRAT 3.0 blocked as generic spyware. Hats off to BitDefender's heuristic analyze.
