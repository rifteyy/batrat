# BatRAT 3.0
üñ•Ô∏è Fast, light-weight remote administration tool made purely in Batch, fully undetected by most anti-malware programs.

Note: The source code will be never released due to the potential of abuse. I do not want my program to be abused by threat actors to cause problems. I am making this GitHub as a documentation for my project.

## üîë How does it work?
There are 2 versions of BatRAT;
- Server
  - Sends commands on PHP website
  - Contains full list of commands
  - Server version has full control of client version
- Client
  - Accepts commands from PHP website that server sends
  - Does all the commands requested and returns on PHP website or a Discord webhook

1) PHP server needs to be setup as C&C
2) Server sends command on PHP server in format `Server;commandname`
3) Client receives command from PHP server, does the command, returns answer on PHP server in format `%username%@%computername%;answer`
